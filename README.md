BOTAID is a AI based chatbot capable of providing information for general medical queries thereby saving time and making friendly conversations without any hesitation. The purpose of this project is to implement a proper healthcare management system integrating all the basic functionalities powered by an Artificial Intelligent chatbot that is capable of having a very organic conversation with the user and solving their queries using knowledge base. The knowledge base is a real-time data collected in a JSON format which is pre-processed to make it ready for further processing using bag of words. The information is received and delivered in both speech and text formats. The chatbot can provide navigation links according to the requests of a user. Furthermore, it is capable of predicting the problem by performing symptom diagnosis and recommending a doctor to be consulted or any immediate measures to be taken. In addition, it also provides information regarding diagnostics beforehand.

Dependencies : 1)Machine Learning and Deep Learning 2)NLP and RNN Algorithms 3)Python Libraries 4)Flask(web development for front end) 5)Google Collab
